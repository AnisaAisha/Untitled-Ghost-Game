[Story]
O-Oh hello... Everyone calls me Lucky Ghost... but I'm not sure where that comes from...
I mean... I've gotten free coffee from  a lot of ghosts... since they happened to have an extra...
And although some restaurants forget my order... they always give me a free item or pay for my meal...
And teachers never called on me in class when they were randomly selecting students...
B-but I've never won the lottery or anything...
[End]

[Story]
O-oh... my luck...?
I-I do appreciate the free stuff... but since it's random... I guess I'm not particularly proud of it...
P-people keep saying I just got lucky in life... b-but I tried so hard...!!
But t-they just brush me off and say it's all because I'm just lucky...
[End]

[Story]
H-hey do you want a free coffee... oh right... you run a cafe...I-I was so excited too...
O-oh, d-did I just come here for that...? Well, I-I just wanted to chat...
Some of the other ghosts were saying that I should have been g-grateful to be so lucky... but I-I still had problems and everything else...
Like do they think I can write an essay with pure luck...?
Or I-I don't know... make close friends...? 
And... be happy just because I'm lucky...?
[End]

[Story]
Hello again!
I-I guess I just wanted to say... it's just really nice to have someone listen... instead of invalidating all my problems...
My luck may have its ups and downs, but I do think finding this cafe was lucky...!
Thank you for everything...!
