[Story]
You know, this small little shop really reminds me of the coffee shop near the medical school I attended.
The barista there always had a huge smile on her face as she gave everyone their orders. She messes up a few times, but she always tries her best.
Keep it up, I’m sure it will all pay off one day.

[Story]
You know, it always amazes me how much someone’s life can change through someone else’s actions.
As a doctor, I’ve treated so many patients. Some of them were old, barely hanging on to life but still fighting to stay with their loved ones as long as possible.
Others were young, hurt by things out of their control. People of all ages and backgrounds all come to the hospital for the same purpose, for another chance at life.
Whenever I see their smile or the smile of their loved ones, I realize how much I changed their lives.
When I was young, I never could have imagined what direction my life would go. But it was all thanks to a stranger that I became who I am today.
I hope I can find them one day so I can thank them.

Hey… Have you seen… Never mind.
This shouldn’t be something I should bother you with. If you wish to know, however, I’m looking for a certain soldier.
He was the stranger I mentioned last time. I heard from some other ghosts that he might have been seen here.
I… I have to find him.
He was the reason why I lived to be a doctor.
Why I… even got a chance live in the first place.
I had an illness when I was young. And because our village didn’t have a doctor, I was certain I was going to die.
But when our village was attacked by some enemies, that soldier saved me
I didn’t want his sacrifice to be in vain, so I pushed myself to live.
When relief came and the doctors there cured me, I dedicated myself to become a doctor as well.

[Story]
I finally found him! The Soldier!
I’m so glad I was able to find him, though it seemed like he had forgotten all about me.
I didn’t recognize him at first, but the dog tag he had was the one the soldier who saved me had, so it must be them!
He tried to be humble when I thanked him for what he did, but there’s no way I could just brush it off!
He was the one who motivated me to keep going! To live for others! If it weren’t for him, I would have either died by those enemy soldiers or died from my illness.
I.. I think I’m ready to move on now that I was able to say my thanks.
I’m really glad that this place existed.
Thank you for the drinks. I’m sure that they helped change some people’s lives for the better.
