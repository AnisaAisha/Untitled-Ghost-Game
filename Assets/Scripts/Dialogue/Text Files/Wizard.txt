[Order]
My, the {item} has been stated in the tomes to... increase one's <italic>magical prowess and mana retention...</italic> <wiggle>yes, yes,</wiggle> I will take one.
[End]

[Success]
Ah, I can feel my magical powers <shaky>surging...</shaky> I will be sure to recommend this location to the others...
[End]

[Failure]
It seems as though the ancients were mistaken. I certainly felt my magic flicker for a moment. Hmm... I must record this so that no others go through this sorrow as well.
[End]

[Story]
Ah, let me introduce myself. I am one of the ancient wizards of the lands, known as <wiggle><bold>Xetharion Xenon Xylarthos</bold></wiggle>, <wiggle><bold>Seer of the Astral Plane</bold></wiggle> and <wiggle><bold>Sage of the Enchanted Woods</bold></wiggle>.
I have devoted myself to the study of <italic>magic.</italic> <wiggle>
Yes...</wiggle> The world holds many great powers, and I was born with the exceptional ability to harness their forces and strengths...
[End]

[Story]
Ah, you wish to know about my studies with magic?
Magic is in the world all around us, yet, many of us are more attuned to it than others. Being one of the <italic>chosen</italic>, I have devoted my life to these duties... <wiggle>yes, duties...</wiggle> to protect the world from the malevolent beings that plague the spirit realm.
How do we do this? <italic>Quartz, purified holy water...</italic> and of course a <italic>salt magic circle</italic> should seal the area for many years to come... 
[End]

[Story]
Have I ever cast a spell?
Ah, the public misunderstands the use of magic...
One must not rely on the arcane so easily, yes. As a wizard of the <wiggle><bold>Sect of the Enchanted Woods</bold></wiggle>, I swore on my life that I would use my powers to <italic>protect</italic> others from learning of the arcane world.
So, of course I have... <wiggle>yes, yes.</wiggle> But the public? They shall <shaky>NEVER.</shaky>
You see, my brethren and I have also sworn to never allow anyone into the world of magic... it is quite... <italic>dangerous</italic> and can only be handled by the greatest of wizards...
[End]

[Story]
Other wizards?
<wiggle>Yes, yes...</wiggle> we form discreet societies where we discuss <italic>sensitive arcane matters</italic>...
We gather at the guild hall, hidden from the prying eyes of the populace, and begin our weekly congregation...
Tea, of course, is the best beverage to enhance one's mana, so indubitably a kettle of the <italic>finest</italic> quality is present at every meeting...
To learn more about the arcane world around us, we exchange tomes and other magical novels and forage for magic-imbued items such as <italic>sprightly mushrooms</italic> and <italic>shimmery rocks</italic> and <italic>ornate crystals...</italic> <wiggle>mmm yes...</wiggle>
It is one of the greatest joys of my life...
[End]

[Story]
Many do not believe in my magic and have ridiculed me for my behaviors, condemning my wizardly existence by saying it was all fake...
You know,  sometimes I begin to doubt it too... After all, when one lacks proof, their faith... wavers...
Ah, but I myself have <italic>proof</italic> of course, yes...
But I simply cannot reveal my powers to the public...
I must continue onward, <italic>protecting the world from the shadows...</italic> as to not forsake my people and myself...
